# Process

__29th August:__ Decided to include all responses, also the ones that were giving a negative rating. While plotting, I noticed there are too many age categories so limiting this. Deleted the other two versions. Added age and gender to the respondents. Created pie charts showing the age and gender of respondents. Added more charts which I need to review before pushing. Need to give myself some time to think about the bigger picture. Else, everything is too flat.
