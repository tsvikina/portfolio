# Impact of DIY Music Spaces on Local Communities

## Project Overview

This project investigates the role of DIY music spaces in fostering community engagement, cultural exchange, and local economic development. The analysis uses randomly generated survey data to demonstrate the methodology and techniques employed.

## Data

The survey data used in this analysis was synthetically generated to simulate responses related to visit frequency, event types, community connection, perceived benefits, and overall impact rating.

## Methodology

1. **Data Generation**: A Python script was used to create a dataset with 100 randomly generated survey responses.
2. **Data Cleaning**: The generated data was cleaned and prepared for analysis using Pandas.
3. **Data Analysis**: Descriptive statistics and visualizations were produced to explore the survey responses.
4. **Reporting**: Key findings and visualizations were compiled into a brief report.

## Disclaimer

The data used in this project is synthetic and for demonstration purposes only. The results do not reflect real-world data. Future work will involve collecting and analyzing actual survey data to provide accurate insights.
